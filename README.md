SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

1. **Personalized Question Bank**

 
   - Generates interview questions tailored to a candidate’s resume, career history, and job role.
  
    
   - Ensures relevant, role-specific questioning for engaging and targeted interviews.  


2. **Dynamic Question Flow**

   
   - Adapts questions in real-time based on candidate responses.
  
      
   - Increases complexity for detailed answers and redirects for brief responses to ensure clarity and depth.
  
      

3. **Relevancy Scoring**

   
   - Uses NLP to evaluate answers for clarity, depth, and job relevance.
  
      
   - Assigns a relevancy score to help interviewers objectively assess candidates’ expertise.
      

4. **Speech & Expression Analysis**

    
   - Analyzes tone, pace, and clarity to assess confidence and communication skills.
  
      
   - Tracks facial expressions to provide insights into engagement, stress levels, and professionalism.
     

5. **Advanced Virtual Interview Environment**

    
   - Provides a real-time interactive platform that mirrors in-person interviews.
  
       
   - Supports video/audio communication, screen sharing, whiteboards, and document sharing.
  
      
   - Enables multiple interviewers, real-time ratings, collaborative commenting, and anonymous evaluations.
  
     
   - Ensures a fair, unbiased, and well-rounded candidate assessment.
